# Data-Cleaning-Challenge
This data cleaning project birthed from a challenge organized by Promise Nonso and Victor Somadina. Last year, I learnt the data cleaning process from my Udacity data analyst course, but I have not being able to get my hands on a personal real world project. So I see this as an opportunity to showcase my technical skill on data wrangling.

### About the dataset
The dataset was gotten from a FIFA EA video game. It consists of details about football game players, ranging from their ratings in their skills to their club and nationality. It was a really a messy and untidy data. It violates the Quality and Tidiness required of a dataset  before Exploratory/Explanatory works on. It has 77 columns and 18,000+ rows. 

### The data cleaning process
The data was cleaned using Python, on the Visual Studio Code Jupyter extension. I assessed the data both visually and programmatically. The visual part was done using Excel, while the programmatic part was done using Pandas. 

I was able to find out the following issues:
- A colomn with more than one datatype (This is something I am coming across for the first time).
- Duplicate entries.
- Missing values.
- Redundant columns which were dropped.
- Some column not properly stored.
- A column containing more than one attribute ('Team & Contract' column).
- Some date column are not in international date standard.

These are some of the issues with the data to mention but few. I was successful addressing the issues.

In conclusion, I was able to achieve the goal of the challenge, which is practicalising  the technicalities of data cleaning I have learnt over time. The cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis and modelling. The data cleanind process is transparent and reproducible for assessment by others, and future updates or extensions of the project.
